## The game features list

I have added the following features to the original game:

- Add a Start button
- A game over message is displayed in the middle of the gameboard instead of an alert window.
- The style of the game is changed (the game is in the middle of the page and there is an header and instructions messages).
- The player image is a mouse, and the game board background is an animated gif image. 
- Increase the size of the gameboard.
- The player can be move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
- The player has 3 lives. Each time a live is lost, the player changes color. You lose 100 points when the player dies.
- There is a colision emoji when a cat hits the player.
- Bonus rewards in the form of cheeses have been added to the game. There are 3 cheeses at a time in random places in the board game. The player must get them if he wants to earn points. The higher the cheese is on the game board, the higher its value. When the 3 cheeses have been caught, 3 more appear.
- A score is added to the game. You earn points when you catch a cheese and you lose points when you lose a life.
- There is a sound when the player hits a cat. There is a different sound when it gets a cheese.
